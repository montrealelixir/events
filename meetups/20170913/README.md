One of the key new features in Phoenix 1.3 is the addition of Contexts. I used this new feature in an application that should be going into production soon. In this presentation I discuss:

- about my application
- what are Contexts?
- how are Contexts used in Phoenix?
- why are Contexts good?
- what next?
